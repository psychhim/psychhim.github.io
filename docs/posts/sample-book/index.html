best friend Milo, a mischievous squirrel, and Tessa, a brave rabbit. Lila was always eager for adventure,
and she had heard stories about the &ldquo;Hidden Forest,&rdquo; a magical place that no one dared to enter.
Legends said the forest was full of enchanted creatures and secrets, but no one had ever returned from
it.</p><p>One sunny morning, Lila decided it was time to explore. &ldquo;Are you ready for an adventure?&rdquo; she asked
Milo and Tessa.</p><p>&ldquo;Always!&rdquo; squeaked Milo, and Tessa nodded with excitement.</p><p>As they ventured into the forest, the trees seemed to welcome them, whispering secrets in a language
only they could understand. The air was filled with the scent of pine and flowers, and the ground
beneath their feet was soft.</p><p>They followed a narrow path deeper into the woods, and soon, they heard the sound of bells—gentle
chimes that seemed to float on the wind.</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! The forest has its own song!&rdquo; Lila exclaimed.</p><p>Following the sound, they came to a clearing where a giant tree stood with silver leaves and branches
that sparkled like stars. At the base of the tree was a wooden door covered in intricate carvings, glowing
with an otherworldly light. The door hummed with magic.</p><p>&ldquo;This is it!&rdquo; Lila whispered. &ldquo;The door to something magical.&rdquo;</p><p>Milo scampered up a tree, his tail twitching. &ldquo;I think we’re close to something special!&rdquo;</p><p>Tessa sniffed the air. &ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; she asked. The bells were louder now, coming from the tree.</p><p>Lila crouched down to examine the door. &ldquo;It’s locked,&rdquo; she said, noticing the keyhole at the bottom.
&ldquo;There must be a way to open it.&rdquo;</p><p>Just then, a tiny fairy fluttered out of the glowing branches. &ldquo;To open this door,&rdquo; the fairy said, &ldquo;you must
find the Lost Key. Follow the trail of fireflies, and it will lead you to what you seek.&rdquo;</p><p>With that, the fairy vanished, leaving only a trail of sparkling dust behind.</p><p>Lila, Milo, and Tessa exchanged excited glances. They were ready for the next part of their journey.</p><p>&ldquo;Let’s follow the fireflies!&rdquo; Lila said, and with that, they began to follow the glowing trail deeper into the
Hidden Forest, eager to uncover its secrets.</p><hr><h2 class=heading id=chapter-2-the-lost-key-to-the-magic-realm>Chapter 2: The Lost Key to the Magic Realm<span class=heading__anchor> <a href=#chapter-2-the-lost-key-to-the-magic-realm>#</a></span></h2><p>Lila, Milo, and Tessa followed the sparkling trail of fireflies deeper into the Hidden Forest. The glow from
the tiny creatures flickered in the growing twilight, lighting their path through thick vines and towering
trees. The air was cool now, and the sounds of the forest seemed to hum with magic.</p><p>“I can feel it,” Lila said, her eyes wide with excitement. “The Lost Key is close. I just know it!”</p><p>Tessa’s long ears twitched. “It’s getting quieter. The fireflies are leading us to something.”</p><p>Milo, always ready for mischief, darted from tree to tree, keeping close to the firefly trail. “I hope it’s
something shiny! I love shiny things!”</p><p>As they walked, the forest began to change. The trees grew taller and more twisted, their bark
shimmering faintly in the moonlight. Strange flowers bloomed at their feet, their petals glowing in soft
blues and purples. The deeper they went, the more the forest felt alive—like it was watching them,
guiding them forward.</p><p>After a while, the fireflies led them to a small clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a stone
pedestal, covered in moss and vines. Atop the pedestal lay a small, golden key, glowing with a soft light.</p><p>“That’s it!” Lila gasped, running toward the pedestal. “The Lost Key!”</p><p>Milo hopped up onto the pedestal to get a closer look. “It’s even shinier than I imagined!” he squeaked.</p><p>Tessa carefully sniffed the air. “Something feels strange,” she said, her eyes scanning the shadows around
them.</p><p>Lila reached out to take the key, but as her fingers brushed against it, a loud <em>crack</em> echoed through the
forest. The ground beneath them trembled, and the trees around them began to shift, forming a circle
that trapped them in the clearing.</p><p>“What’s happening?!” Lila shouted, stepping back in alarm.</p><p>Suddenly, a low voice boomed from the shadows. “Who dares to take the Lost Key?”</p><p>From the darkness, a figure stepped forward—tall and shadowy, with glowing eyes and a cloak made of
swirling mist. The figure’s voice was deep and powerful. “I am the Guardian of the Lost Key. No one may
take it unless they prove themselves worthy.”</p><p>Lila’s heart raced, but she stood tall. “We need the key to open the door in the Hidden Forest. We didn’t
come to take it for ourselves—we came to unlock the magic.”</p><p>The Guardian’s glowing eyes studied her closely. “Many have tried to take the key, but none have
succeeded. If you truly seek the magic, you must pass the Test of Courage.”</p><p>Lila, Tessa, and Milo exchanged nervous glances. “What’s the Test of Courage?” Lila asked.</p><p>The Guardian raised a hand, and suddenly, the ground around them began to shift again. The stone
pedestal vanished, replaced by a swirling fog that filled the clearing. A deep voice echoed from the mist.
“Face your fears, young ones, and only then shall the key be yours.”</p><p>Lila felt the air grow heavy. The mist twisted around them, forming shadows that seemed to whisper
their deepest fears.</p><p>Lila’s heart raced as a figure stepped out of the fog—it was a giant wolf, its eyes glowing with an eerie
red light. She froze, but then remembered the bravery she had shown all her life. “I won’t be scared,”
she whispered to herself, stepping forward. “I can do this.”</p><p>The wolf growled, but Lila stood firm. Slowly, it backed away, vanishing into the mist.</p><p>Tessa’s fear came next—she saw a shadowy figure of a giant rabbit looming over her, casting a long,
terrifying shadow. But instead of running, Tessa stood tall, her bravery shining through as she faced the
shadow and chased it away.</p><p>Finally, Milo’s fear appeared as a dark storm cloud, swirling above him and threatening to rain down
lightning. But Milo wasn’t afraid—he scurried up the nearest tree and leaped from branch to branch,
laughing as the storm fizzled away.</p><p>The fog cleared, and the Guardian’s voice rang out again. “You have all faced your fears and shown your
courage. The Lost Key is yours.”</p><p>Lila reached forward and picked up the golden key, feeling its warmth in her hand. The forest around
them seemed to brighten as the magic of the key filled the air.</p><p>“Well done,” the Guardian said, his voice softening. “Now go—unlock the door in the Hidden Forest, and
your journey will continue.”</p><p>With the key in hand, Lila, Milo, and Tessa smiled at each other. Their adventure was far from over, but
they had proven their courage, and the next step of their journey was waiting for them.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Lila said, her heart pounding with excitement. “The door is waiting.”</p><hr><h2 class=heading id=chapter-3-the-heart-of-the-hidden-forest>Chapter 3: The Heart of the Hidden Forest<span class=heading__anchor> <a href=#chapter-3-the-heart-of-the-hidden-forest>#</a></span></h2><p>Lila, Milo, and Tessa stood at the edge of the Moonlight Tree, gazing into the dense forest that stretched
out before them. The air was thick with magic, and a sense of mystery seemed to wrap around every
branch and leaf. The forest was alive in a way they had never experienced before—every rustling leaf,
every breeze seemed to whisper secrets.</p><p>“Are we ready?” Lila asked, her voice full of excitement and a touch of uncertainty.</p><p>Milo, sitting on her shoulder, flicked his tail and gave an eager chirp. “I’ve been ready since we stepped
into the forest!”</p><p>Tessa&rsquo;s ears twitched as she gazed into the shadows, a little nervous but determined. “I think we’re as
ready as we’ll ever be. Let’s stick together and keep our wits about us.”</p><p>They nodded in agreement and stepped into the forest, their footsteps soft on the mossy ground. The
forest was quiet—too quiet. It felt like they were being watched by invisible eyes. The trees towered
above them, their trunks thick and ancient, their leaves shimmering with a faint glow. As they walked
deeper into the forest, the moonlight filtered through the canopy, casting eerie shadows on the path.</p><p>After walking for what felt like hours, they reached a clearing where the trees parted, revealing a
shimmering pool of water. The surface reflected the moon and the stars above, glowing with an almost
otherworldly light. But it wasn’t just the beauty of the pool that made Lila’s heart race—it was the
feeling of magic that seemed to pulse from the water, as if it were alive.</p><p>“What is this place?” Lila whispered, kneeling down to touch the surface of the water.</p><p>Before anyone could answer, a soft voice echoed through the clearing. “You stand at the heart of the
Hidden Forest, the place where all magic begins.”</p><p>Lila, Milo, and Tessa jumped back, startled. From the center of the pool, a figure rose—a spirit made of
light and water, her form glowing softly with the colors of the moon. She was tall and graceful, her hair
flowing like water, her eyes bright with ancient wisdom.</p><p>“I am the Guardian of the Heart,” the spirit said, her voice as soft as a breeze but filled with a strength
that sent a shiver down Lila’s spine. “I have been waiting for you.”</p><p>“Waiting for us?” Lila asked, still kneeling by the water, unsure of what was happening.</p><p>The Guardian nodded. “The Hidden Forest has chosen you. You have come seeking its magic, but to
unlock its true power, you must understand the balance of the forest. The magic of this place is not
something to be taken—it is something to be protected.”</p><p>Tessa stepped forward, her tail flicking with curiosity. “But we don’t want to take anything. We just want
to understand it, protect it, and share it with others.”</p><p>The Guardian’s eyes softened, and she smiled. “That is why you are here. But to prove that you are
worthy, you must first face the forest’s trials. You will encounter challenges that test your courage, your
trust, and your heart. Only those who succeed in these trials may continue deeper into the forest and
unlock the magic it holds.”</p><p>Lila felt a spark of excitement in her chest. “What kind of challenges?”</p><p>The Guardian’s smile faded slightly, and her gaze turned serious. “The challenges are not easy. The forest
will show you your deepest fears, your greatest weaknesses. You will face creatures born of shadow and
light, each one more powerful than the last. But through it all, you must remember: it is not just about
power. It is about the choices you make, the strength of your heart, and the bonds you share with those
around you.”</p><p>Milo hopped off Lila’s shoulder and scampered around the edge of the pool, his eyes wide with awe. “So,
we have to pass some sort of test?”</p><p>The Guardian nodded. “Yes, but the tests will not be physical. They will test your spirit, your resolve. The
forest will show you what lies within.”</p><p>Tessa’s ears perked up, and she turned to Lila. “We can do this. Together.”</p><p>Lila felt a surge of determination. She looked at Milo and Tessa, their faces filled with the same resolve.
Whatever trials lay ahead, they would face them as a team.</p><p>The Guardian raised a hand, and the water of the pool began to swirl. The moonlight above them
flickered, casting long, eerie shadows on the ground. A soft wind blew through the clearing, carrying the
scent of earth and magic.</p><p>“Are you ready?” the Guardian asked.</p><p>Lila took a deep breath, her heart racing with excitement and nerves. “We’re ready.”</p><p>With a gentle nod, the Guardian gestured toward the forest. “Then go, and let the trials begin.”</p><p>As they stepped into the forest, the air around them seemed to shift. The trees whispered secrets to one
another, their branches creaking in the wind. Lila could feel the magic growing stronger with every step
they took. The path ahead was dark, but the soft glow of the moonlight guided them forward.</p><p>The deeper they went, the more alive the forest became. Strange creatures appeared in the shadows—
flashes of glowing eyes, the sound of rustling leaves—but nothing seemed to approach them. Lila
couldn’t shake the feeling that the forest was watching them, waiting for them to prove themselves.</p><p>After a while, the path ahead forked, and at the center of the fork stood a massive stone archway, its
surface covered in glowing runes. Lila stepped forward, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>“This must be the first trial,” she said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Tessa nodded. “Let’s do this.”</p><p>They approached the archway together, feeling a strange pull to step through it. As they did, the world
around them seemed to twist and shift. The air grew colder, and the light dimmed. The path ahead was
no longer the one they had been walking but a dark, twisted version of it.</p><p>The forest was no longer peaceful. Strange, shadowy creatures lurked just out of sight, and a sense of
dread filled the air. The once-shimmering trees now seemed to close in on them, their branches reaching
out like skeletal hands.</p><p>Lila swallowed hard. This was only the beginning of the trials, and already, the forest was testing them.
Would they make it through? Or would the forest consume them before they even had a chance?</p><p>&ldquo;We’ll face it together,&rdquo; Lila said, turning to Milo and Tessa. &ldquo;Let’s not forget why we came here. We have
to protect the magic of this place.&rdquo;</p><p>With renewed determination, they took their first steps into the heart of the trial, knowing they had to
face whatever challenges the Hidden Forest would throw at them. Together, they would prove they were
worthy of the magic the forest guarded so fiercely.</p><hr><h2 class=heading id=chapter-4-the-battle-of-the-firefly-knights>Chapter 4: The Battle of the Firefly Knights<span class=heading__anchor> <a href=#chapter-4-the-battle-of-the-firefly-knights>#</a></span></h2><p>The path beyond the Moonlight Tree led Lila, Milo, and Tessa deeper into the Hidden Forest, where the
trees grew taller and their twisted branches seemed to touch the sky. The air buzzed with magic, and the
deeper they walked, the more alive the forest felt. The moon cast a soft glow over the path ahead, and
soon they entered a clearing where the ground sparkled with hundreds of glowing lights. As they moved
closer, they realized it was a sea of fireflies, swirling and flickering in beautiful patterns, lighting up the
dark forest.</p><p>&ldquo;Look at them!&rdquo; Milo whispered, his eyes wide with wonder. &ldquo;There are so many!&rdquo;</p><p>The fireflies danced gracefully around them, creating intricate shapes and symbols in the air, as if trying
to tell a story. Lila took a cautious step forward, when suddenly, the fireflies parted, and from the center
of the glowing lights emerged a figure—a knight, shimmering and radiant, his armor made of thousands
of glowing fireflies.</p><p>“I am Sir Lumis, Knight of the Firefly Order,” the knight’s voice rang out, clear and melodious, like the
sound of distant chimes. “The Hidden Forest has called to you. But to move forward, you must prove
your worth. Only those who succeed in the trials may pass.”</p><p>Lila stood tall, her heart beating faster with excitement. &ldquo;We are ready for whatever comes next,&rdquo; she
said, her voice steady.</p><p>Sir Lumis raised his glowing sword, and the fireflies around him began to form into groups, each one
taking on the shape of a knight, their light flickering like stars in the night sky. The forest grew quieter, as
if holding its breath.</p><p>“The first trial is a test of courage,” Sir Lumis said. “You must face the Firefly Storm.”</p><p>Without warning, the fireflies began to swirl and flicker wildly, their light flashing brighter and faster,
creating a storm of light that filled the air. It was dazzling and chaotic, the flashes overwhelming Lila&rsquo;s
senses. The storm whirled around them, whipping at the air and making the ground tremble beneath
their feet.</p><p>Lila’s heart raced. Milo jumped onto her shoulder, his tail twitching nervously, and Tessa’s ears stood tall,
sensing the danger. The storm felt impossible to navigate. Yet, through the confusion, Lila stood her
ground. She took a deep breath, refusing to let the storm shake her.</p><p>“We can do this,” Lila said firmly, her voice cutting through the chaos. “Together, we’re strong enough.”</p><p>Milo squeezed her shoulder, and Tessa nodded. They all stood tall, focusing on each other and the path
ahead. Slowly, the fireflies calmed, and the storm of light began to fade away, leaving behind a peaceful,
glowing stillness.</p><p>&ldquo;You have shown courage,&rdquo; Sir Lumis said, his voice deep and approving. &ldquo;The first trial is passed.&rdquo;</p><p>The fireflies danced in the air, their lights shifting to a new pattern, signaling the next trial. Sir Lumis
raised his sword again.</p><p>“The second trial is a test of trust,” he declared. “You must follow the path I create, no matter the
obstacles.”</p><p>The fireflies parted, revealing a glowing, winding path that stretched deep into the forest. As Lila, Milo,
and Tessa began to walk, the path seemed to shift and twist, like the forest itself was testing them. The
trees moved, branches closing off certain routes, while other paths appeared to lead nowhere.</p><p>Lila’s eyes darted from path to path, unsure which direction to take. But then she remembered the
words of the Moonlight Tree: <em>Only by trusting in each other can you find the right way.</em> She turned to her
friends, her heart steady.</p><p>“We have to trust each other,” she said. “Let’s go together.”</p><p>Milo scampered ahead, climbing onto a nearby tree to scout the way. Tessa stayed low, keeping an eye
on the ground for any hidden dangers. They moved carefully, always checking with one another before
making each decision. Together, they found their way through the maze, relying on their trust and
teamwork.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, the fireflies cleared the path, and Sir Lumis nodded.</p><p>“You have shown trust. The second trial is passed.”</p><p>Now, the final trial awaited. The fireflies gathered together, and the air grew still. Sir Lumis spoke again,
his voice echoing with the weight of the test to come.</p><p>“The last trial is a test of heart. You must answer this question: Why have you come to the Hidden
Forest?”</p><p>The fireflies surrounded Lila, Milo, and Tessa, their lights glowing more brightly than ever. Lila felt her
heart race. This wasn’t just about magic or adventure—it was about something deeper. She stepped
forward, looking at her friends.</p><p>“We came to discover the magic of the Hidden Forest,” she said. “But not just for ourselves. We want to
protect this place and share its wonders with others. We believe that magic is meant to help people, and
we want to make sure it’s safe.”</p><p>Milo nodded, his voice full of conviction. “We want to share the beauty of this place with everyone we
can.”</p><p>Tessa’s tail swayed behind her as she added, “We came to find our purpose and to protect the magic that
makes this world so special.”</p><p>For a moment, the fireflies swirled in the air, their light flickering softly. Sir Lumis was silent, his glowing
eyes studying them. Then, a smile spread across his face, and the fireflies erupted in a dazzling display of
light, filling the sky above them with bursts of sparkling color.</p><p>“You have shown courage, trust, and heart,” Sir Lumis said, his voice warm with approval. “You are
worthy. The Hidden Forest has accepted you.”</p><p>The firefly knights bowed to them, their light dimming as they slowly faded into the night. The forest
around them seemed to come alive with a new energy, and the path ahead glowed brightly, beckoning
them forward.</p><p>“The magic of the Hidden Forest is now yours to protect,” Sir Lumis said one final time, his voice soft and
fading. “Go forth, and let your journey continue.”</p><p>With their hearts full of pride and excitement, Lila, Milo, and Tessa turned and walked down the glowing
path, ready to uncover the next mystery of the Hidden Forest, their bond stronger than ever.</p><hr><h2 class=heading id=chapter-5-the-dawn-of-a-new-beginning>Chapter 5: The Dawn of a New Beginning<span class=heading__anchor> <a href=#chapter-5-the-dawn-of-a-new-beginning>#</a></span></h2><p>Lila, Milo, and Tessa stood in awe at the edge of the vast, glowing meadow, their hearts still racing from
the final trial. The forest, which had once felt so mysterious and intimidating, now seemed to hum with
energy, its magic alive in the air. The moon had set, and the first rays of dawn began to filter through the
trees, casting golden light across the meadow. It was as if the Hidden Forest itself was waking up to the
new day.</p><p>“I can’t believe it’s over,” Lila whispered, her eyes wide with wonder as she looked around. “We actually
made it. We passed all the trials.”</p><p>Milo leaped onto her shoulder, his tail swishing with excitement. “Of course we did! We’re magical
explorers now! Nothing can stop us!”</p><p>Tessa, who had been silently watching the transformation of the forest, stepped forward, her eyes filled
with pride. “This place&mldr; it feels so different now, doesn’t it? Like it’s come alive in a way I can’t explain.”</p><p>Lila nodded. The air felt lighter, as if the forest had been holding its breath and was finally exhaling. The
once-foreboding shadows had lifted, replaced by a warmth and peace that settled deep in their hearts.</p><p>As they moved toward the center of the meadow, they saw it: a large stone pedestal, its surface etched
with intricate glowing runes. Atop the pedestal, a shimmering crystal sphere floated serenely, casting
soft, radiant light in every direction. It was beautiful, like a piece of the sky itself had come down to rest
upon the earth.</p><p>“That’s it, isn’t it?” Lila murmured, awe in her voice. “The Heart of the Forest. The magic we’ve been
protecting all along.”</p><p>Milo tilted his head and blinked. “Wait&mldr; that little thing is the magic of the Hidden Forest? It’s so&mldr;
shiny.”</p><p>Tessa’s tail flicked with excitement. “It’s not little—it’s everything. It holds the magic of the forest, the
power that keeps this place alive. It’s what the Guardian meant when she said we were chosen.”</p><p>Lila felt her heart beat a little faster. She knew the responsibility that came with holding the Heart of the
Forest. The magic inside it wasn’t something to be taken lightly. But she also felt an overwhelming sense
of peace, as if the forest was telling her she was ready.</p><p>As she reached out to touch the crystal sphere, a voice—gentle but powerful—echoed through the
meadow.</p><p>“You have done it. You have completed the trials and proven your worth,” the voice said. It was the
Guardian, now appearing before them in a glowing form, her light bright and warm as the sun’s rays.
“But this is not the end of your journey. It is only the beginning.”</p><p>The trio stared at her, their eyes wide. They had thought they were done—that they had proven
themselves and now the magic would be theirs to keep. But the Guardian’s words made it clear: their
adventure was far from over.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Lila asked, her voice filled with curiosity.</p><p>The Guardian’s smile was kind, her eyes filled with ancient wisdom. “The forest’s magic is not meant to
be hidden away, to be kept only by a few. It is meant to be shared with the world, to help those who
need it most. And that is why you were chosen. You are not only protectors of the forest, but guardians
of the magic that lives within it.”</p><p>Milo jumped up, his fur glowing softly in the light. “So, we’re supposed to take the magic out of the
forest? Like&mldr; give it to everyone?”</p><p>Tessa’s ears perked up. “But how do we do that? How do we share something so powerful?”</p><p>The Guardian looked at them all with pride. “By spreading the message of the Hidden Forest’s magic—its
ability to heal, to protect, and to inspire. You are the bridge between the forest and the world outside.
The magic will flow through you, and with it, you can help people find balance in their lives, heal broken
hearts, and protect the land from harm.”</p><p>Lila took a deep breath. It was a responsibility beyond anything she had ever imagined, but it also felt
right. “We’re ready. We can do this.”</p><p>The Guardian nodded. “You have shown the strength of heart, the trust in each other, and the courage
to face the trials. Now, you must continue your journey. The world outside the Hidden Forest needs you.
But remember this: the magic of the forest will always be with you. As long as you carry it with respect
and love, it will guide you.”</p><p>With a wave of her hand, the Guardian summoned a soft wind, and the crystal sphere began to glow
even brighter. The light enveloped the trio, swirling around them like a warm, comforting embrace. As
the magic of the forest flowed into them, they could feel it—its pulse, its rhythm, its life force. It wasn’t
just a power to wield; it was a part of them, flowing in their veins.</p><p>“Go forth with the blessing of the forest,” the Guardian said, her form beginning to fade. “May your
hearts stay true, and your spirits remain strong.”</p><p>And then, with a final smile, the Guardian disappeared, leaving behind only the shimmering light of the
Heart of the Forest. But the magic remained, nestled in Lila’s heart, Milo’s spirit, and Tessa’s quiet
strength.</p><p>The trio stood together, their hands resting on the pedestal. The forest around them seemed to sigh, a
peaceful exhale that filled the air with hope. The once-mysterious world of the Hidden Forest was no
longer a place of uncertainty; it had become their home, a place they would protect and honor.</p><p>Lila took the crystal sphere into her hands, its soft glow casting light across her face. “We’re not just
protectors anymore. We’re the keepers of something greater. We’re the bridge between this world and
the Hidden Forest.”</p><p>Milo chirped, his voice full of excitement. “And we’re going to share it with everyone! Imagine what we
can do!”</p><p>Tessa, who had been quiet until now, nodded thoughtfully. “It’s more than just magic. It’s about helping
people. The forest is teaching us that.”</p><p>With the Heart of the Forest safe in their hands, the trio turned toward the path leading out of the
meadow, ready to begin their new journey. The forest seemed to glow even brighter as they left, its
magic swirling around them, lighting their way forward.</p><p>Together, they would face whatever challenges came their way. Together, they would spread the magic
of the Hidden Forest, sharing its wonders and its wisdom with the world. The adventure wasn’t over; it
had only just begun.</p><p>As they stepped into the sunlight, Lila smiled, her heart full of hope. Whatever the future held, they
were ready. And with the magic of the forest in their hearts, there was nothing they couldn’t do.</p><p>The Hidden Forest had chosen them, and now, they would choose the world.</p><p>The end of one journey, the beginning of another.</p><nav class=page-nav><a class=page-nav__previous-link href=/posts/the-murder-on-the-links/>Prev: The Murder on the Links</a>
